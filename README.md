### A simple Twitter bot on a journey to 1000 digits of Pi

## Installation and Setup
If you wish to run your own Twitter bot with this code, or your own version of it, you should have already set up a Twitter account and connected it to a [Twitter Dev](https://developer.twitter.com/) account to obtain your own consumer keys and access tokens that you will place on `pibotconfig.js`. I have included an example of what this file should look like.

You will need `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.

**Installation**:

`npm install`

`npm update`

**To Start**:

`npm start`

If set up correctly, you should see the first tweet appear after a few seconds.

## Reflection
Pi1000 was a day long project I decided to build to learn more about Javascript, node and APIs.

Having jumped right into React and Angular after learning HTML and CSS without learning Javascript first, I knew I had to take a step back and reinforce the basics.

Since this was my first time working with an API, I decided to install the `Twit` npm package to make my life a little bit easier first time around while working with the Twitter API. I also used a simple API to get the digits for Pi that you can read more about [here](https://helloacm.com/pi/).

I believe there are probably better ways to achieve what I have made here (I'm not even sure what will happen if the server goes offline for a few minutes), but I just wanted to test out the waters :)

In the end I had a lot of fun and learned a lot about all the technologies used.
